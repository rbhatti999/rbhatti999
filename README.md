- 👋 Hi, I’m @rbhatti999
- 👀 I’m interested in software engineering, software development, data science, and machine learning. I like to program with Python and I also like using the AWS Cloud. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about the AWS Cloud and expanding my program skills. I am also learning basic machine learning and training for more AWS Cloud Certifications. I also am studying API (rest API's specifically), CI/CD pipeline, basic SQL.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... nothing at the moment but I am open to collaboration if I'm reached out to. 
- 📫 How to reach me ... You can reach me through here or through my email robeelbhatti19@gmail.com!
